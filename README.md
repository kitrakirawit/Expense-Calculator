# Expense-Calculator
Student Expense Tracker
A simple and effective web-based application that helps students take control of their finances. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project was designed to solve a real problem: students often struggle to manage income and expenses while juggling school, work, and life.

Motivation
As a university student myself, I realized how easy it is to lose track of spending — especially when your income is scattered across part-time jobs, bursaries, and other sources. I built this app to help students visualize their cash flow in one place, track how much they’re earning versus spending, and develop healthier financial habits.

My goal was to make something:
Simple and intuitive — anyone can use it
Lightweight and fast — no installations, just open and go
Expandable — this is just the beginning

Features
Add multiple income sources (e.g., part-time jobs, scholarships)
Add categorized expenses (food, rent, transport, etc.)
Real-time balance calculation
A clean summary section showing total income, expenses, and balance

Fully built with JavaScript, no frameworks or dependencies

Tech Stack
HTML5
CSS3 
JavaScript

What’s Next
This is a version 1 release — the foundation. I plan to continue building on it by:
Adding data persistence using localStorage or Firebas
Implementing editable and deletable entries
Creating visual graphs with Chart.js
Allowing students to set monthly budgets and savings goals
Possibly integrating user login to personalize data

Final Thoughts
This isn’t just a coding exercise — it’s a project born out of a real need. I hope other students find it useful, and I'm excited to keep improving it.
If you’re a developer, mentor, or just someone interested — I’d love your feedback.

Thank you for checking it out.
